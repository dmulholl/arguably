# Arguably

Arguably is a minimalist Rust library for parsing command line arguments. Its features include:

* Long-form boolean flags with single-character shortcuts: `--flag`, `-f`.

* Long-form string-valued options with single-character shortcuts: `--option <arg>`, `-o <arg>`.

* Condensed short-form options: `-abc <arg> <arg>`.

* Automatic `--help` and `--version` flags.

* Support for multivalued options.

* Support for git-style command interfaces with arbitrarily-nested commands.
